 Simple application to learn javascript

Using Java Script I have created a Pokedex. 
Everything is secured in an IIFE to prevent interference. I then access this information using keys. Using JSON I retrieve the Pokemon information from pokeapi.co and create buttons for each of their perspective names to be displayed in a grid. I first wrote my own modal and then introduced bootstrap to be able to use their modal function. Using bootstrap I also made sure that it was accessible using their classes in the navigation bar of the application. While cycling through the application you will get four different statistics of each pokemon as well as an image of them.
